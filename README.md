Project Title: CGPA/SGPA Calculator
Team Size: 2
Course: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Language: C++

Project Description:
Developed a console-based CGPA/SGPA Calculator using C++ as a project for the Object-Oriented Programming course. The application calculates semester-wise GPA and cumulative GPA based on user input of course credits and grades. Implemented core OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and constructors to structure and manage academic data efficiently. The project emphasized modular code, reusability, and practical application of object-oriented design principles.
